# picotools
A set of command-line utilities to make working with the Raspberry Pi Pico in C/C++ a little more fluid.

Whilst the utilities themselves should be cross-platform, the install script is not - it only works on Linux. CMake and make must also be installed for use of the build commands.

# Installation
To install, run `install.sh` with root privileges. This will install `picotools.py` as `picotools` in `/usr/bin/`.
